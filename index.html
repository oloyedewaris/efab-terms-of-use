        <h2>ACCESSING THE WEBSITE AND ACCOUNT SECURITY</h2>
        <p>
          We reserve the right to withdraw or amend the App, and any service or
          material we provide on the App, in our sole discretion without notice.
          We will not be liable if all or any part of the App is unavailable at
          any time or for any period. From time to time, we may restrict access
          to some parts of the App, or the entire App, to any user, including
          registered users.
        </p>
        <h3>You are responsible for:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Making all arrangements necessary for you to have access to the App.
          </li>
          <li>
            Ensuring that all persons who access the App through your internet
            connection are aware of these Terms of Use and comply with them.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          To access the App or some of the resources it offers, including,
          without limitation, payment using credit cards, debit cards, or other
          forms of electronic payment, you may be asked to provide certain
          registration details or other information. It is a condition of your
          use of the App that all the information you provide on the App is
          correct, current, and complete. You agree that all information you
          provide to register with this App or otherwise, including through any
          interactive features on the App, is governed by our Privacy Policy,
          and you consent to all actions we take with respect to your
          information consistent with our Privacy Policy. If you choose, or are
          provided with, a one-time password (OTP), password, or any other piece
          of information as part of our security procedures, you must treat such
          information as confidential, and you must not disclose it to any other
          person or entity. You also acknowledge that your account is personal
          to you and agree not to provide any other person with access to this
          App or portions of it using your email, password, or other security
          information. You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized
          access to or use of your email or password or any other breach of
          security. You also agree to ensure that you exit from your account at
          the end of each session. You should use particular caution when
          accessing your account from a public or shared computer so that others
          are not able to view or record your password or other personal
          information.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may only have one account with this App. Use of more than one
          account will constitute a breach of these Terms of Use.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have the right to disable any account, password, or other
          identifier, whether chosen by you or provided by us, at any time in
          our sole discretion for any or no reason, including if, in our
          opinion, you have violated any provision of these Terms of Use. To
          ensure secure online payment and all other transactions of personal
          data, the App uses SSL (Secure Socket Layer) technology. SSL encrypts
          all communications between your device and our server so that the
          information can only be read and understood by us. A closed lock on
          your browser window usually indicates a secure connection. For further
          information, please consult your browser’s security specifications. If
          your browser is equipped with SSL, your transaction will automatically
          be secured. The common standard in the internet to signal a secure
          site is a closed lock at the bottom of the browser. As long as the
          lock is displayed closed, your information is secure and encrypted to
          avoid misuse. If you click the secure transaction link and still
          cannot see the closed lock, it may be that the window is nested in
          another frame.

          additional fees and/or charges levied by either a nominated financial
          institution or the Company and you shall remain responsible to pay any
          due amounts. Without prejudice to the foregoing, you shall notify us

        </p>
        <p>
          If any transaction is found to be incorrect, unauthorized, or

          submitted for payment. Upon receiving the funds into our bank account,
          we shall accordingly issue a proper receipt acknowledging the same.
          All transactions will be processed without delay; however, the Company
          expressly disclaims any and all liability for processing delays, which
          may occur in any circumstance. Payment is not accepted (not deemed
